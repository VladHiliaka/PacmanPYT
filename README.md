# Pac-man game
## Game Overview
My game is a Pacman-inspired arcade game developed using Python and the pygame library. It offers a main menu where players can choose from two pre-created skins or create their own custom skins to be displayed in the game. The game consists of three levels, each with its own unique challenges.
### Level 1: Classic Pacman
The objective is to navigate a maze, collect coins, and avoid ghosts. Once all the coins are collected, the player proceeds to the next level.
### Level 2: King of Spirits
The second level introduces the boss character called the King of Spirits. Players must defeat the King of Spirits by killing him four times. However, the King of Spirits can summon ordinary spirits making the gameplay more challenging.
### Level 3: Demon's Wrath
The final level pits players against a powerful demon. The demon creates fireballs and drops them on the Pacman character from the sky, adding another layer of difficulty. This level introduces two new items to aid players: invulnerability and character acceleration.
